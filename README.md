# Parallel-Graph-Metric-Computation

A graph consists of a set of vertices and a set of edges. The number of vertices is **V**. The number of edges is **E**. Each edge connects a pair of vertices. The distance between two vertices is the length of the shortest path between those two verticesâ€”that is, the number of edges in this shortest path. If there is no path between the two vertices, the distance between them is infinity. The **eccentricity** of a vertex is the largest distance between that vertex and any other vertex. The **radius** of a graph is the smallest eccentricity of any vertex in the graph. The **diameter** of a graph is the largest eccentricity of any vertex in the graph. A **central vertex** in a graph is a vertex whose eccentricity is equal to the graph's radius. A **peripheral vertex** in a graph is a vertex whose eccentricity is equal to the graph's diameter. 

For example, here is a graph with 10 vertices and 12 edges:
